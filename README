# 🦀 KOX NFT — Stage One (Foundation & Launch Prep)

## 📌 Overview  
KOX NFT is the **first-ever NFT collection powering KOX**, the AI + Blockchain assistant designed to redefine mobile systems.  
This collection is more than digital art — it’s a **utility-driven gateway** into the KOX ecosystem.  

Holders of KOX NFTs will enjoy:  
- ✅ Early access to the KOX AI assistant app.  
- ✅ Entry into the **builder & tester whitelist**.  
- ✅ Future identity perks & token-gated features.  
- ✅ Exclusive participation in KOX future drops.  

This is not just an NFT drop.  
It’s the **beginning of a movement**. 🚀  

---

## 🎨 1. Concept Finalization  
- **Theme:** KOX avatars represent futuristic digital identities.  
- **Utility:** NFTs double as **early access passes** and ecosystem identity keys.  
- **Vision:** Demand for KOX NFTs will grow with adoption of KOX products, driving both **community growth** and **NFT value**.

## 🖼 2. Artwork & Metadata  

**Current Status:**  
- Rust project can **randomly generate NFT traits** (Background, Head, Eyes, Mouth, Accessory).  
- Metadata is stored in structs and printed in the console.  
- Images are not yet added — the project currently outputs **trait selections** instead.  

**Next Steps for Avatar Creation:**  
1. **Collect / create images** for each trait:  
   - Backgrounds  
   - Heads  
   - Eyes  
   - Mouths  
   - Accessories  
2. **Organize them in folders** matching the trait names for easy retrieval.  
3. Update Rust generator code to:  
   - Compose images programmatically using the `image` crate.  
   - Overlay selected traits to form a complete NFT avatar image.  
4. Export **final avatar image files** and link them in metadata JSON.  

**Rarity tiers:**  
- 🟢 Common  
- 🔵 Rare  
- 🟣 Legendary

## 🔗 3. Smart Contract Planning  

**Current Status:**  
- Planned ERC-721 style contract logic (minting, transfer, metadata).  
- Not yet deployed — only trait generation exists in Rust.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Deploy NFT contract on **KOX Testnet** for validation.  
- Link Rust-generated metadata with the contract for minting.  
- Test minting & transfers with early testers.  

---

## 🌍 4. Website & Minting Page  

**Next Steps:**  
- Build a lightweight **dApp** with wallet integration (Sui Wallet, Suiet, Ethos).  
- Show minting supply counter in real-time.  
- Allow NFT preview (once images are generated).  
- Simple, mobile-first UI/UX.  

---

## 📢 5. Community & Marketing Prep  

- Launch **KOX NFT Discord & Telegram**.  
- Share **sneak peeks** of avatars & roadmap.  
- Run **Whitelist Campaigns** for early supporters.  
- Build organic hype before testnet drop.  

---

## 🧪 6. Testnet Prep  

- Deploy NFT contract to **KOX Testnet**.  
- Allow early testers to mint for free.  
- Collect feedback & fix issues before mainnet.  

---

## 🚀 7. Mainnet Launch (Future)  

- Official KOX NFT Mint Event.  
- Announce **mint date, supply, and pricing**.  
- Introduce first wave of KOX NFT holders into the ecosystem.

# ✅ Progress Covered So Far (Technical Stage One)  

- ⚙️ **Rust Project Setup:** `cargo new KOX-NFT` initialized the project.  
- 📦 **Dependencies Added:** `serde`, `sha2`, `uuid`, `image`, and `rand` crates integrated.  
- 🧑‍💻 **Core Logic Implemented:**  
  - NFT struct defined in `lib.rs`.  
  - Random trait generation implemented in `generator.rs`.  
  - Unique ID generation using `uuid`.  
- 🧪 **Unit Testing:**  
  - Minting → ✅ Passed  
  - Transfer → ✅ Passed  
  - Unique ID → ✅ Passed  

**Output so far:** Console prints randomly generated NFT traits like:

```text
NFT generated: GeneratedNFT { background: "Cyber Grid", head: "Quantum Lens", eyes: "Laser Blue", mouth: "Neutral", accessory: "Holo Shield" }

Next Steps (Technical)

Add images for each trait and integrate them with Rust generator.

Compose full NFT avatar images programmatically.

Export image + metadata JSON ready for blockchain.

Link metadata to testnet smart contract for minting.

Prepare website/dApp for public interaction.
